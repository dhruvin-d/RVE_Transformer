# RVE_Transformer
Visual transformer and CNN models implemented for Representative Volume Element (RVE) structural properties homogenization.
Neural network based approach for structural property prediction is an excellent low computation alternative to Finite Element Analysis. 

Total 3 models are trained: 
1. ViT similar to the original paper
2. mini-ViT with smaller encoding
3. CNN
